# write a shell script that takes output from chatgpt prompt and outputs back to input into the terminal

#I assume you want to write a Python program that does the following:

#1. Starts a subprocess running a shell script
#2. Communicates with the subprocess to send input to it and receive output from it
#3. Outputs the output received from the subprocess to the terminal

#Here's one way to do it:


import subprocess

# Start the subprocess running the shell script
p = subprocess.Popen(['bash', ''], stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

# Loop forever, communicating with the subprocess
while True:
    # Get input from the user
    user_input = input('> ')

    # Send input to the subprocess
    p.stdin.write(user_input.encode())
    p.stdin.write('Pylance')
    p.stdin.flush()

    # Read output from the subprocess
    output = p.stdout.readline().decode().strip()

    # If the subprocess has finished, break out of the loop
    if p.poll() is not None:
        break

    # If there is output, print it to the terminal
    if output:
        print(output)


#Replace `your_shell_script.sh` with the name of your actual shell script. When you run this Python program, it will start the shell script as a subprocess and send user input to it. The output from the shell script will be printed back to the terminal.
